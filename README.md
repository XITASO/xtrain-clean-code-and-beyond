## Working in VS Code

- Open the folder with VS Code
- Make sure you have the remote container extension installed  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers 
- Make sure you have docker installed
- You should be prompted to open the folder in the container
    - otherwise "Reopen in container" through the command menu
- VSCode reloads with a connection to the container
- After an initial load time you should see the Java projects in the explorer and you can start and debug the application
- API is available on port 8080

The initial setup may take a while because the containers must be built locally!
